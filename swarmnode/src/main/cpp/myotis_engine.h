/*
 * Plain C ABI of the Myotis Rust engine (rust/myotis-engine/src/capi.rs).
 * Consumed by the :app-ios Kotlin/Native cinterop; keep in lockstep with
 * capi.rs and bump MYOTIS_ABI_VERSION expectations on any shape change.
 *
 * Conventions (identical to the hand-JNI surface):
 *  - Compound values cross as JSON strings; schemas are pinned by the golden
 *    tests on both sides of the JNI seam and shared verbatim here.
 *  - Every char* RETURNED by these functions is owned by the caller and must
 *    be released with myotis_string_free (never free(3)).
 *  - Errors are sentinels, not exceptions: negative handle ids from
 *    myotis_create, false from start/pause/resume, "{}" status for an unknown
 *    handle, {"error": "..."} objects from the verified reads.
 *  - Verified reads are BLOCKING with a cooperative ~90 s operation budget.
 *    Cancellation drains started native execution; indivisible native work may
 *    overrun the budget. Call off the UI thread.
 *  - EVM execution admits at most eight actual closures process-wide; further
 *    execution fails immediately with "native execution busy". Hosts must bound
 *    their queues and retry busy reads within their own deadline; there is no
 *    additional native semaphore-wait queue.
